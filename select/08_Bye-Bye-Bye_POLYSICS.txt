Thank you arigato
"Sayonara" is Bye-Bye
Thank you arigato
For a good, oh Bye-Bye

Don't leave anyone out
With gratitude bye-bye
Today and this day farewell, oh Bye-Bye
Even if it's tomorrow
Even if I can't see you
Today and this day
Farewell, oh Bye-Bye

Thank you good night

Thank you arigato
"Sayonara" is Bye-Bye
Thank you arigato
For a good, oh Bye-Bye

Even if I'm alone
Make as if I'm happy Bye-Bye
Today and this day,
For now it's Bye-Bye
Even if there's no tomorrow
Even if I get run over
Even if everyone dies
For now it's Bye-Bye

Thank you good night
